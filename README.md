# Infinite-TicTacToe
it's a TicTacToe that can have whatever grid size you wish.

when starting the program you'll be asked to input a number which will be used to generate the table.

the rules are the same as regular tic tac toe, if you mark in a line of 3 you win.


I've started coding a few months back so I'll gladly solve any reported glitches as I'm still learning and this is my first actual project.
